<h3>WHO I AM</h3>
<p>My given name is Cahlen Riley, and my family’s name is Lee. I am a living man born on November 23rd, 1981 in the geographical region commonly referred to as Cowlitz County of Washington State to Riley Dennis Lee and Victoria Mae Lee (maiden name Willis).</p>

<p>I declare my political status as an American state national born within the physical borders of Washington State.</p>

<h3>JURISDICTION</h3>
<p>I am a man operating within the Natural Law on the land and soil, meaning the only law I am subject to is, “Do no harm.”</p>

<p>All contracts I have with the UNITED STATES, STATE OF WASHINGTON, STATE OF NEW MEXICO or any of their incorporated, parent or sister entities, were signed Vi Coactus and/or without full understanding or disclosure, and are therefor not legitimate or binding upon me. I am not a ward, member or citizen of these organizations, I do not hold any office in them, and I waive any benefit which requires any performance from me I do not wish to engage in. It is my wish that these organizations do not initiate contact with me.</p>

<h3>VALIDITY OF CONTRACTS</h3>
<p>The only contracts I consider valid and binding upon me are those which are made between me and another living being.</p>

<h3>DIPLOMATIC STATUS</h3>
<p>I am not at war with any people or entities, or aware of any which consider themselves to be at war with me.</p>

<h3>AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES</h3>
<p>No individuals or organizations are permitted to serve as my agent or representative.</p>

<h3>LIABILITY FOR THE ACTIONS OF OTHERS</h3>
<p>I do not accept liability for the actions of others except in cases where I have agreed to serve as the parental guardian of the individual.</p>

<p>I am probably wrong about some of the things I say in my content, so you are advised to do your own research before acting upon the information, and I do not accept responsibility for your actions.</p>

<h3>STOPPAGE OF AND/OR RESTITUTION FOR HARM</h3>
<p>If you feel I am causing, have caused or am threatening to cause you harm, it is my wish that you contact me directly via <a href="mailto:mail@cahlen.org">mail@cahlen.org</a> to ask me to desist or provide restitution.</p>

<p>If we can not work it out privately between the two of us then we may convene a public court via video chat to be made public on major videos publishing sites. The court will contain jury members consisting of equal amounts people of each of our choosing, and a neutral administrator of proceedings which we both agree upon. To be valid we must both agree beforehand to abide by any unanimous decisions of the jury.</p>

description: It's been awhile since the last update of my journey back home to Washington state with my buddy Jeremiah the Nomad Man. This is a quick video update on some of our adventures since you last heard from us, which includes an earful of baby tics, the 4Runner saving the day after a tow truck broke itself trying to pull Jeremiah's van from a sand pit, and 3 bears circling our camp as we huddled around a campfire near Yosemite.

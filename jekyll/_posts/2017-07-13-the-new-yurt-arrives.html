<p>After a lot of research I decided to go with a 12-foot diameter yurt made by the folks over at <a class="keychainify-checked" href="http://www.campingyurts.com/">campingyurts.com</a> because they're lightweight and easy to put up and take down.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy watching the unboxing and my first attempt at putting a yurt together!</p>

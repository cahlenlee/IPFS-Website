description: Living nomadically has its risks, so I spend a decent amount of time implementing backup plans for worst scenarios. I like to think about this topic in terms of Fractals, which are systems with patterns which repeat themselves as you examine the individual components.

<p>For example, if my truck breaks down while I'm 20 miles into the desert, then I have my electric bike to get me to town, and if that breaks down I have a backpack with everything I need to survive a long trip on foot. At every level I maintain my ability to travel safely and comfortably.The same goes for shelter, clothing, food and water. </p>

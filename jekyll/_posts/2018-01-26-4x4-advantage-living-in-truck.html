<p>Most camping or boondocking locations tend to have a heavy concentration of RVs and Vans right near the entrance from the main road. This is because those vehicles have a difficult time on uneven roads and terrain. So even though there's miles of land that you're allowed to drive to, hardly anyone goes out there... unless they have a vehicle with power to all 4 wheels!</p>

<p>I've really been enjoying this advantage so far because it guarantees me some privacy and some peace and quiet. It's also really fun to drive into the mountains on an old bumpy dirt road.</p>

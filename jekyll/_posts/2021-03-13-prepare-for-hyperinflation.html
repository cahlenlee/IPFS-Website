description: Hyperinflation is in process, and there's really nothing that can stop it. If you have fiat currency stored in a bank you may want to consider converting that into things which will not lose value (e.g. land, food, gear) and putting some of it into cryptocurrency for a limited time to maintain your ability to purchase things as the dollar dies.

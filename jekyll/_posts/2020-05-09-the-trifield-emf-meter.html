<p>EMFs are a natural phenomenon in our environment and in our bodies, but these days there are also non-natural EMFs in our environment which have negative effects on our health.  For this reason is can be beneficial to have a tool which can detect these invisible effects so that we can minimize the detrimental effects they have on our wellbeing. </p>

<p>If you'd like more information on EMFs, you can check out my podcast interview of Scott Compton from EMF Warriors here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjISH7K7gCk">https://youtu.be/bjISH7K7gCk</a> </p>

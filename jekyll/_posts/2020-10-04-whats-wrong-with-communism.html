description: While I know a lot of people who are communists, and believe that the intentions of most people following this political philosophy are good, ultimately there are some serious problems with the idea.  These problems are for the most part only present when Communism is implemented as a non-voluntary system, which is unfortunately how most communists try to put these ideas into effect.

description: Evil is an action chosen by an individual which they believe improves their situation, but does so at the expense of other people. Large scale examples of evil would include the decades of torture and murder which took place in the gulags of communist Russia. A small example of an evil action could be a job applicant lying in an interview.

<p>We all have the capacity to commit evil actions. Some commit evil as readily as they take any other type of action, while others might hold to their principles until they are tortured or the well-being of their child is threatened. Perhaps their are some who would never break in any situation, but if so they are surely far and few between. </p>

<p>The solution to evil in the world is an awareness of and commitment to the truth about our own personal tendencies towards evil, and also the realities of the evil occurring in the world around us. Only then can we truly commit to avoiding our own initiation of evil actions and begin to stand up against the evil perpetrated by others. </p>

description: While I generally try to avoid discussing politics, I feel compelled to share my thoughts on the state of America in case it will be helpful to you in planning for what I believe will be a tumultuous future.

<p>Most Americans see only the left/right paradigm, and don't even consider the possibility that there is something bigger going on. Republican vs. Democrat is just another example of the age-old strategy of divide and conquer. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The current situation is that Leftists are being led to believe that Biden won the election, and social/mainstream media are shielding them from all of the evidence about election fraud, so they think anyone claiming fraud is crazy. Folks on the right are aware of the election fraud since they tend to get their information from non-censoring sites. If Trump wins the left will go full bonkers thinking he stole the presidency, and if Biden wins the right will be forced to defend the republic from the now obvious corruption. Either way, it seems that violence is a near certainty. </p>

<p>The controllers of this world want to see America destroyed. Not necessarily the nation itself, but what it stands for in the minds of the world. Despite plenty of horrible things occurring in the name of America in the past, the foundational core of this country is Natural Law, which means all are free to do as they please as long as they do not harm anyone. </p>

<p>While most of the world will fall easily into the coming technocratic slavery system, America may not, and if it doesn't then the other countries may eventually resist as well. This is why they believe they must destroy America. </p>

<p>Just to be clear, while I relate to the desire to believe that Trump is here to save the republic, I suspect he ultimately is also a puppet manipulated by the controllers, whether he's aware of it or not. He's such a polarizing person, perfect for the divide and conquer strategy. </p>

<p>First, it is a Blue Moon which means it's the second Full Moon in the same month, a very rare occurrence. Second, the moon is at the closest it gets to Earth, meaning it looks bigger than usual. This is called a Super Moon. And third, right before the moon sets there will a Blood Moon which is an eclipse where the light from the sun passes through the Earth's atmosphere filtering out the blue light leaving only red.</p>

<p>Quite the combination wouldn't you say? I'm told we won't experience this again in for decades.</p>

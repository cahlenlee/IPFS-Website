description: Today on Ask Cahlen I'll be answering the question, "What do you eat?" I have a feeling the person asking this question is specifically curious about what I eat when I'm living nomadically on my Solar eBike, but my diet is a little different now that I'm living in a cabin in the mountains, so I'll describe both situations.

<p>When living nomadically I focus on compressing as much food into as little space as possible.  In the morning I drink Hot Chocolate with Coconut Oil, Cacao Powder and Xylitol to keep me in ketosis and gain many of the benefits of intermittent fasting.  For dinner I usually have either white rice or oats cooked with salt and Coconut Oil.  For my daily greens I rely on tablets of Spirulina and Chlorella which provide me with a huge number of different necessary vitamins and nutrients.</p>

<p>My diet is pretty similar when living a more stationary life, with a few differences.  I still drink the Hot Chocolate in the morning, which contains over 1000 calories of fat.  For dinner I generally eat white rice or sweet potatoes with vegetables fried in coconut oil. I also will eat eggs and grass-fed butter.</p>

<p>Things of course change from day-to-day, but the general idea is fat-fueled intermittent fasting with clean carbohydrates and greens for dinner. I avoid wheat, dairy (except butter) and cooked vegetable oils. Everything is organic, grass fed and pastured.  </p>

<p>In general I follow the Bulletproof Diet, which has completely changed my life over the last two year.  <a href="https://www.bulletproof.com/diet/bulletproof-diet/the-complete-illustrated-one-page-bulletproof-diet/">Check out this poster</a> describing what to eat and not eat in an easy to understand way.</p>

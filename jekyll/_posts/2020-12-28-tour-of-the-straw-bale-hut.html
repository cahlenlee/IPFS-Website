<p>Those of you who have followed me for awhile know that I like to live in small places. Gers, yurts, trucks, and now a straw bale hut. There’s something so nice about simplicity in life, and I’m being drawn more and more in that direction every day. </p>

<p>I’ll probably be here until late March of 2021, and then we’ll see what happens. At that point I might decide to stick around, or maybe I’ll pack everything into my backpack and set off on an on-foot nomadic adventure. We’ll find out together! </p>

description: In this episode of Ask Cahlen I'll be answering the question, "Why did you become a wizard? I wouldn't necessarily say there was a time that I became a wizard. I feel more comfortable saying that I realized I was a wizard. I see it as one of the many roles in a well functioning society

<p>My definition of a wizard is someone who seeks Truth, uses it with Wisdom and shares it with others wishing to do the same. By that definition there are many wizards in the world, as theoretically any true scientist would qualify. Unfortunately many modern sciencists turn their eyes away from truth by choosing to focus solely on the material world and to ignore the spiritual, so I personally don't view them as wizards.</p>

description: Today on Ask Cahlen I will be answering the question, "What was Wardenclyffe Tower?"  Wardenclyffe Tower was an uncompleted project of Nikola Tesla in the early 1900s which was designed to transmit data and energy wirelessly across the planet by utilizing the innate electromagnetic properties of the Earth. If it had been completed, we would have had free energy and wireless internet decades before the 21st century. Unfortunately, JP Morgan canceled the project when he discovered the intention was to provide free energy worldwide.

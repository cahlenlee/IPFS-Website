description: LBRY is an open-source decentralized file storage and sharing service with an integrated cryptocurrency called LBC.  It can store any type of file, though the project's development is currently focused on video streaming.  Users are rewarded with LBC for participating in various ways, such as viewing videos or creating and uploading video content.

<p>The benefits of LBRY are that it is open-source and decentralized, which means it is safe to use and censorship resistant.  If you already have content on YouTube, you can set it up to automatically duplicate it on the LBRY network, and it will continually add your new videos on YouTube to your LBRY channel as you upload them. </p>

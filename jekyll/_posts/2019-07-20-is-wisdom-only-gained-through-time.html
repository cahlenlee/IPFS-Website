description: Today on Ask Cahlen I will be answering the question, "Is wisdom only gained through time?" In order to answer this question I must first give my definition of 'wisdom'.  To be wise is to act in accordance with Natural Law.  This requires the understanding and acceptance of the fact that the universe will always reflect back to you what you put into it. So to be wise means to act in a way which is beneficial to others, for it will ultimately end up being beneficial to you as well.

<p>I believe understanding Natural Law is the default state of any being, and that humanity has lost touch with that through the millions (and perhaps billions) of years that we've existed on this planet. I do believe one can get back in touch with that understanding instantly, but suspect it will always take time to incorporate that back into our lives.</p>

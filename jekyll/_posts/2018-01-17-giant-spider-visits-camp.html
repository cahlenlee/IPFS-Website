description: A giant spider crawled out from underneath my truck while I was getting some water in the camp! Well, it's big compared to the spiders where I come from, though when it comes to tarantulas, this one is pretty small.

<p>I used to be freaked out by spiders when I was younger. I was forced to be exposed to one regularly for a long period of time and the fear just wore off eventually. I'm not sure it's worn off so much that I'd want this thing crawling on me though.</p>

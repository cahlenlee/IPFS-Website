description: Welcome to Day 2 of my week long Jemez Mountains adventure! The original plan was to head north towards some caves near a river I know of, but I ran out of water too quickly, and needed come up with another plan. An impromptu trek down an abandoned road ended up working out better than I could have imagined!

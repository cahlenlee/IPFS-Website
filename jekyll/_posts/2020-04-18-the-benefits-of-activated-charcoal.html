<p>Activated Charcoal is created by burning various materials at high heat and sometimes adding zinc and/or calcium.  This process creates a highly porous negatively charged form of carbon which binds to numerous toxins and carries them out of the body. </p>

<p>Activated Carbon is used in hospitals in cases of food or pharmaceutical poisoning.  It's also great for dealing with gas.  I like to use it for brushing my teeth to avoid the toxic chemicals found in most toothpastes. </p>

<p>I recommend getting a form of Activated Charcoal made from Coconut Hulls that's produced by a responsible company.  Here's the kind I currently use: <a href="https://shop.bulletproof.com/collections/detox-gut-health/products/coconut-charcoal-capsules-90-ct">Bulletproof Activated Charcoal</a> </p>

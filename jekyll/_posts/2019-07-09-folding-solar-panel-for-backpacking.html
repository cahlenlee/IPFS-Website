description: While I'm traveling on foot with just my backpack I always take my folding solar panel to charge my various devices. It can power anything which uses USB, including my phone, lighter, and lots of other useful toys. I love the feeling of independence that is provided by knowing I can rely on the free energy of the sun to keep my technology running.

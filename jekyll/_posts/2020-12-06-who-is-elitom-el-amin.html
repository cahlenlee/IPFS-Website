<p>A friend of mine hosted him as a guest at his house for over a week and reports that Elitom did not eat or drink anything. I've met Elitom in person and watched dozens of his videos, and I do not see him as someone who is likely to be lying about his abilities. Also, there has been scientific research done on Breatharianism which indicates there may be something worth exploring here. </p>

<p>Imagine a world where you didn't need to eat to survive. How much simpler would it be? For me, I see a life of complete freedom, as so much of the hustle and bustle of life is ultimately for the purpose of securing food. </p>

<p>Now imagine a world full of people who don't need to eat to survive. How many of the big problems we face would simply disappear? </p>

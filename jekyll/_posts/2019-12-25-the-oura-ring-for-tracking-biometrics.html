<p>The Oura Ring is primarily designed to track sleep quality, but also tracks daily activity, heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), body temperature and respiration rate. This allows those of us who are fine tuning our biology to track the effect of the things we try on our health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>I love my Oura Ring, and definitely recommend it to anyone interested in tracking their personal biometrics so they can optimize their biology.  You can order one on the Oura website.  If you don't know your ring size, they also sell sizing kits for a few bucks.</p>

description: On the episode of Wizard Gear I'll be showing you one of the most important tools I keep with me at all times - The Boruit Tactical Flashlight.  This hardy flashlight is compact, waterproof and recharges through USB.  This means I can keep it in my pants pocket at all times, even during heavy rain, and when it starts to run low I can recharge it using my folding USB solar panel.  It has multiple brightness settings up to 1200 lumens.  It also has different colored light modes, and various flashing modes for emergency situations.

<h3>LIGHT, COMPACT & RUGGED</h3>

<p>Those of you who follow my Wizard Gear series, you know that it's important to me to only carry gear which is light and compact.  This tactical flashlight is super lightweight, and fits multiple places on my pants without being intrusive.  </p>

<p>I carry this flashlight with me everywhere I go, because I never know when I'm going to need it, and it comes in handy so often.</p>

<p>Since I spend a lot of time out in the wilderness, the fact that it's waterproof is a huge benefit.  I don't have to worry about shielding it from the rain.  Also, I've dropped this flashlight on rock many times and it's still functioning perfectly.</p>

<h3>RECHARGEABLE BATTERY</h3>

<p>I'm always thinking about equipping myself with gear which will assist me in survival situations where I won't have access to society for long periods of time.  This flashlight uses a rechargeable 18650 battery which means I won't need to run to a store anytime its depleted.</p>

<p>Because the flashlight charges through USB, I can use my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-PowerPort-iPhone-Galaxy/dp/B012YUJJM8">Solar USB Charger</a> to replenish the battery anywhere I have access to the sun.  Luckily in New Mexico that means pretty much anywhere!</p>

<h3>MULTIPLE LIGHT MODES</h3>

<p>This flashlight has numerous light modes which all come in handy in different situations.  The normal white light has several different intensities I can switch between which allows me to save energy when I don't need an intense light.</p>

<p>It also comes with the ability to switch to Red, Green and Blue light modes.  The red light is great for use at night when I don't want to disturb my body's production of melatonin which would affect my sleep.  The green and blue are mostly useful for getting people's attention.  It even has an emergency mode where it flashes between the three non-white lights.</p>

<p>The last light mode worth mentioning is the SOS mode, where it flashes the morse code for SOS in case I'm in a situation where I need assistance.</p>

<p>If you spend a lot of time outside, work in dark spaces or want to prepare for survival situations, I highly recommend picking up this flashlight. </p>

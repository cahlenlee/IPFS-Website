description: On this episode I visit Crater Lake in Oregon with my traveling buddy Jeremiah the Nomad Man on the way back home to Washington. This lake is the crater of a volcano that erupted 7700 years ago. It's nearly 2000 feet deep making it the deepest lake in the United States.

<p>Definitely an amazing view, though car camping isn't really an option in the park itself. Luckily there were plenty of places in the nearby National Forest. In the next video we'll be visiting Mount St. Helens in Washington which erupted 2 years before and near where I was born. I'm looking forward to it!</p>

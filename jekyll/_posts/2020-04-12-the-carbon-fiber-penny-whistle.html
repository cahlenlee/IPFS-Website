<p>The Penny Whistle is generally thought to be native to the British Isles, but this type of simple flute can be found in many cultures across the world. It's essentially a hollow tube with holes in it, which can be crafted from various materials such as bamboo, bone, etc.</p>

<p>I've played many instruments in my life, but the Penny Whistle became necessary when I was a minimalist nomad for over a year. It fits easily into a backpack, and the material of this flute isn't effected by the elements.</p>

<p>There are lots of places to pick up a Penny Whistle, but if you want the same one in the video, you can find them here:

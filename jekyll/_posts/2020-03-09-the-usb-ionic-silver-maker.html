<p>Ionic Silver is a form of Silver Nanoparticle Solution. Silver Nanoparticles have been shown through scientific research to destroy bacteria, protozoans and many viruses (including certain strains of coronavirus).  Humans have been using Silver as a disinfectant for thousands of years, and it's still as effective today as it was then. </p>

<p>You can create your own nanosilver solution by immersing the two silver rods of the device in distilled water and then plugging it in to any USB power source for around 3 hours. I got mine from <a href="https://www.honeycolony.com/shop/colloidal-silver-healer/">Honey Colony</a>, but you can find these lots of places online. </p>

description: The common understanding of the Law of Attraction is that what you wish for and think about will tend to manifest itself in your life.  However, this is only one aspect of the Law of Attraction, and leaves out perhaps the most important element which is that you must play your part in bringing what you want into being.

<p>For those of you who are skeptical that the universe brings you what you ask for, I invite you to do a simple experiment in your own life.  Just follow these steps: </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Identify what it is you want.</li>
    <li>Place something in your environment which reminds you of what you want.</li>
    <li>Determine what actions you would need to take for this wish manifest, and do them.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Depending on what you're asking for it can take time for it to come into being, so be patient while continually reminding yourself of your desire and doing your part.  It's also worth noting that, while not required for it to work, following Natural Law (i.e. do no harm) enhances the effectiveness of the Law of Attraction, and ensures that the end result is not tainted with negative aspects. </p>

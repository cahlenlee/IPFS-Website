description: Water is a daily necessity for us all, and when you're living nomadically you often have to get creative about where you're finding it. My favorite spot is from streams or other running water sources, but there is still the problem of microbes to deal with.

<p>There are a lot of good camping filters which do the job, but they're tedious... and I'm pretty lazy.

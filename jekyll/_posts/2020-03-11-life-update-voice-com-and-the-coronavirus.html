description: In this episode I discuss recent changes in my life, including the end of my nomadic days, and the beginning of the phase where I settle down and start a family.  I also discuss my excitement for the new social media platform called Voice which runs on the EOS Blockchain.  And finally I share some of my thoughts on the Coronavirus panic.

<p>This series will eventually be recorded live once I reach 1000 subscribers on YouTube to enable that functionality, but for now I'll just record my thoughts in a single recording without stopping.  I'm looking forward to being able to answer live questions in the future! </p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the episode, as I'm looking forward to making many more of these. </p>

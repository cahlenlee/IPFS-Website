description: Today I'll be giving a quick tour of the exterior of the new home I've moved into, and discussing it's usefulness in survival situations.  Then I discuss Breatharianism, or the ability to live without eating, and how it could benefit humanity.  Finally I talk about whether or not Buddhism believes in the soul.

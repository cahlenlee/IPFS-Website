description: The terms Conspiracy Theory and Conspiracy Theorist are generally used today as a way to discredit a person or idea without considering the claims that are being made.  However, in truth a Conspiracy Theory is simply a hypothesis that two or more people got together in secret to plan something which would cause harm to others.

<p>Many Conspiracy Theories which people were ridiculed for having in the past have turned out to be true.  If you'd like to confirm this for yourself, simply do an internet search along these lines:  "conspiracy theories that are true" </p>

<p>While cautioning people not to discount something simply because it is a Conspiracy Theory, it is equally important to mention that many of these theories are false.  It's a murky and confusing world to dive into, but I invite you to open your mind and dive in... just be sure to maintain discernment! </p>

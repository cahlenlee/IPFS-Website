description: I recently quit my job as a Producer in the Video Game Industry, put the Yurt into storage, packed everything I needed into my truck and drove out to the Southwest Deserts of the United States to soak up some sun! This is probably the best think I've ever done for myself... sweet sweet freedom!

<p>There's tons of BLM land out here owned by the government which you're allowed to hang out on for 14 days at a time. Once that time is up you need to move to another location where you can stay for another 14 days, and you can just hop around like that forever!</p>

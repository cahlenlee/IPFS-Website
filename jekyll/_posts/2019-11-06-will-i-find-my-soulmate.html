description: Today on Ask Cahlen I will be answering the question, "Will I find my soulmate?" A soulmate is generally thought of as someone we incarnated into this life with and with whom we are destined to enter into a life-long intimate relationship.  While I suspect soulmates exist, I think it is better to think of these things in terms of an ideal partner so as not to invoke thoughts of destiny which tend to corrupt our decision making.

<p>If you are asking yourself these sorts of questions, I recommend asking yourself why you want to find your ideal partner.  If your desire comes out of a feeling of lack or incompleteness it's likely the person you attract is not going to be right for you, or the relationship will be fraught with difficulty and inappropriate sacrifice.</p>

<p>My advice is to first address your sense of self-worth, and to identify and commit to prioritizing your life's purpose over finding your ideal partner.  Once you have done this, you can attract your ideal partner by visualizing what the relationship would be like.  Focus primarily on the qualities you will possess in order to be the perfect partner, and then take steps in you life to become that person, and the rest will fall into place on its own.</p>

description: In this episode I visit Mount Saint Helens in Washington state with my traveling buddy Jeremiah the Nomad Man. This volcano last erupted in 1980 and was the biggest eruption the United States has seen, at least as far back as we've been tracking that.

<p>I was born only a few miles away 18 months later, so it was always something people were talking about. I'm glad I finally got to finally visit it for myself! This is the last stop before reaching the Seattle area where I'll be staying for awhile. In the next video I'll explain why I'm here and my plans for the future.</p>

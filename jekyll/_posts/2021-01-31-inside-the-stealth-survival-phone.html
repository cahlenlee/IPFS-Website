description: Looking for a phone that doesn't spy on everything you do? Getting or making your own de-Googled phone may be right up your alley. I call my personal variation of this setup the Stealth Survival Phone, and in this video I give a quick look at some of the apps I use.

<p>Remember, the right to privacy is the same thing as the right to self-defense. If you just give away all of your information willy-nilly then you are waiving that right. </p>

<p>If you'd like to try creating your own de-Googled phone there are plenty of guides online on how to do that, but feel free to get in touch with me if you'd like some guidance. I also am willing to setup the software on the phone for you if you send it to me in the mail. If you request my assistance, I ask that you find some way to return the favor, and <a href="https://gift.cahlen.org">https://gift.cahlen.org</a> shows you a few ways to do that.</p>

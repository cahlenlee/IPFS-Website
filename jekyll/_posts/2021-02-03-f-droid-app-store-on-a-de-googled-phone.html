<p>The F-Droid App Store is a repository of Free and Open Source Android apps. There are thousands of apps to choose from, and you're going to find something for almost any functionality you're looking for.</p>

<p>If what you need isn't on F-Droid, you can still install apps from the Google Play Store using the APK files or the Aurora App Store. If you go this route, I suggest blocking internet access for the app using AFWall+.</p>

<p>Feel free to get in touch with me (mail@cahlen.org) if you'd like help getting your hands on one of these de-Googled phones. If I'm able to help you I ask that you find some way to return the favor via <a href="http://gift.cahlen.org">http://gift.cahlen.org</a>.</p>

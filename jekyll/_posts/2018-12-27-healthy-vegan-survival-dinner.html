<h3>Bulk Food Storage</h3>

<p>As some of you know, my ultimate plan is to move from living in the truck to living off of the <a href="https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radrover-electric-fat-bike">Rad Rover</a> I modified into a Solar eBike.  In order to pull that off I needed a way to store lots of food on the bike so that I could spend long periods of time in the wilderness.  </p>

<p>As you can see, there's lots of space in each of these containers, and the aluminum lining keeps the temperature under control. I found <a href="https://www.radpowerbikes.com/collections/accessories/products/insulated-delivery-bag-small">these on the Rad Rover website</a>, so they fit the bike perfectly. All of the ingredients in this article are stored in these, with the exception of the 25 pound bag of rice...</p>

<h3>Organic White Rice</h3>

<p>White rice is a perfect survival food.  Tons of calories can be packed into a small amount of space while weighing very little since the grains are completely dry, and it's super cheap!  I'm going to upgrade those advantages by grinding it into a powder.</p>

<p>A quick note about brown vs. white rice.  Brown rice does have some more nutrients and fiber than white rice, but it can also carry a large dose of <a href="https://blog.bulletproof.com/the-complete-bulletproof-guide-to-grains/">arsenic in the hull</a>, along with other unpleasant compounds.  Also, all that extra fiber can cause gas.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lundberg-Organic-California-Jasmine-Packaging/dp/B0013JQ1GO">Here's where I currently get my Organic White Rice.</a></p>

<h3>Organic Red Lentils</h3>

<p>Before I turned Vegan I stayed pretty far away from beans and lentils, and for good reason considering the amount of <a href="https://blog.bulletproof.com/revenge-of-the-beans-tomatoes-potatoes-lectins/">health harming lectins</a> they contain. However, I need a good storable protein source which cooked quickly, and red lentils are the best thing I've found so far.</p>

<p>I've been experimenting with various beans and lentils to see how they affect me, since lectin types vary by bean and also effect everyone differently, and Red Lentils had no noticeable negative effect on me. Also, it cooks quickly dissolving into the hot liquid and has a wonderful flavor!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.healthrangerstore.com/products/mini-bucket-organic-red-lentils-72-oz-2040-g">Here's where I buy my Organic Red Lentils.</a></p>

<h3>Organic Dehydrated Vegetables</h3>

<p>Vegetables are arguably the most important part of our diets, and most of us don't get nearly enough. Ideally I'd want fresh veggies with their <a href="https://www.sheknows.com/health-and-wellness/articles/953001/can-you-eat-your-water/">structured water</a> still intact, but when living nomadically sacrifices must be made.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.healthrangerstore.com/collections/freeze-dried-veggies">Organic Freeze Dried Vegetables</a> in this mix to get those much needed nutrients while out in the wilderness. The <a href="https://www.healthrangerstore.com/collections/freeze-dried-veggies/products/freeze-dried-organic-broccoli-5-29oz-10-can-150g-2-pack">Broccoli</a> and <a href="https://www.healthrangerstore.com/products/freeze-dried-organic-whole-corn-18oz-10-can-2-pack">Corn</a> are my favorites, but the <a href="https://www.healthrangerstore.com/collections/freeze-dried-veggies/products/freeze-dried-organic-peas-16oz-10-can-454g-2-pack">Peas</a> are pretty good as well.</p>

<h3>Organic Spices</h3>

<p>Spices are where the fun really begins because they unlock an unlimited combination of flavors for the same basic meal. I've only used the Salt, Pepper and Turmeric combination so far, but I'm looking forward to experimenting with more and hearing your thoughts on good things to try!</p>

<p>By the way, I don't just use Turmeric for flavor, it's also an incredibly healthy spice.  One of the main reasons is its powerful anti-inflammatory properties, but there are <a href="https://foodfacts.mercola.com/turmeric.html">plenty of other benefits</a>.</p>

<p>Here's where I get my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Redmond-Natures-First-Pound-Bucket/dp/B016794Y7C">Salt</a>, <a href="https://www.healthrangerstore.com/products/organic-ground-black-pepper-4oz-113g-1">Pepper</a> and <a href="https://www.healthrangerstore.com/collections/organic-turmeric-root-powder/products/organic-turmeric-root-powder-12oz-340g">Turmeric</a>.</p>

<h3>Grind Into a Powder</h3>

<p>Once I've combined all ingredients into the storage jar, I pour it all into a blender and grind it into a fine powder. I do this with a very powerful blender using my solar panel and a power inverter, and it even had trouble with this, so be careful not to break your weaker blender.</p>

<p>I'll probably convert to using either a battery powered coffee grinder or get a manual hand grinder at some point. While these will both require I spend more time in the grinding process, their packability will be key for when I'm on the bike 24/7.</p>

<h3>Titanium Camp Pot &amp; Stove</h3>

<p>The little <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009MZHRKU">Camp Pot</a> you see me holding in my hand is made of titanium, which means it's super lightweight and extremely sturdy even when heated. It also contains my entire <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TOAKS-Titanium-Backpacking-Burning-Stove/dp/B00SA2H05I">Camp Stove</a> system as well, which relies on sticks and twigs available almost anywhere as fuel.</p>

<h3>Organic Coconut Oil</h3>

<p>Once the water is boiling, I add about 2 Tablespoons of <a href="http://cahlen.org/CoconutOil">Organic Coconut Oil</a>. This adds some healthy calories to the meal along with a nice flavor. It also coats the carbohydrates in the rice with fat which <a href="https://blog.bulletproof.com/low-carb-carbs-hack-your-rice-with-coconut-oil-recipe/">reduces its insulin response</a>.</p>

<h3>Add Powder and Stir</h3>

<p>With the Coconut Oil melting in the water, I begin adding the powdered mixture one spoonful at a time. Mixing here is critical, as it can tend to get clumped up on the bottom of the pot, causing it to get charred and inedible.</p>

<p>I let it boil for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, and then put the lid on and let it simmer for another 20 minutes or so.</p>

<h3>Enjoy a Hot Hearty Meal!</h3>

<p>That's all there is to it! This quick, easy and healthy vegan meal will keep your belly full and warm on the trail or in a survival situation. You can even add it to a thermos and sip on it while you're on the move.</p>

<p>Don't forget to let me know if you discover any good spice combinations!</p>

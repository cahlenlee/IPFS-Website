description: I recently gave my motorized bicycle to my good friend Jeremiah the Nomad Man, and picked up a Rad Rover electric bike (eBike) as my secondary vehicle. Come along as I use the bike to haul a large heavy object 8 miles back from town, while still having over 3/5ths charge in the battery after 16 miles round trip.

<p>This was up and down steep hills so it's pretty impressive in my book… I hope to convert this bike and trailer into my primary transport for cross country nomadic traveling. No licensing, registration, insurance or expensive maintenance, and it's powered by the sun… Yes!</p>

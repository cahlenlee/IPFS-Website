<p>There's a lot of controversy concerning the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.  The polarization around this issue is extreme, with one side believing vaccines are completely safe and represent humanity's greatest medical achievement, while the other side claims they are only marginally effective and carry with them extreme risks for autism, neurological disorders and autoimmune diseases.</p>

<p>Let's begin an exploration of the potential issues by first discussing what vaccines are, how they work, and the common ingredients.</p>

<h2>What are Vaccines?</h2>

<p>Vaccines are a form of medication containing dead or weakened versions of disease-causing microorganisms, such as bacteria or viruses, which triggers the immune system to learn how to fight off the illness before it becomes a problem.<sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/vpd-vac-basics.html">1</a>)</sup></p>

<h2>What is in Vaccines?</h2>

<p>Many believe that the dead or weakened pathogen is essentially all there is to a vaccine, but there are many other ingredients thrown into the mix for various reasons.  Let's take a look at a few of these.</p>

<h4>Adjuvents</h4>

<p>The dead or weakened versions of the target microorganisms are often unable to trigger the body's immune system enough on their own for the vaccine to work, so other ingredients called 'adjuvents' are added to the vaccine to boost the immune response.<sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html">2</a>)</sup</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Aluminum</strong><sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html">2</a>)</sup> - A neurological and immune toxin which accumulates in the body's tissue. Linked to Alzheimer's Disease, seizures, depression, autoimmune issues, autism, neurological disorders, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and cancer.<sup>(<a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jt/2014/491316/abs/">3</a>,<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0961203311430221">4</a>,<a href="https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/52/19/5391.short">5</a>,<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1385/NMM:9:1:83">6</a>,<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/14/11/2227">7</a>,<a href="http://hpvupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Gardasil-20-9-2015-LT-EDITED-FINAL-VERSION-FOR-SUBMISSION.pdf">8</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3P6wVUH0pc">9</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X84710783">10</a>,<a href="https://fr.prepareforchange.net/files/2017/11/Tomljenovic_Shaw-CMC-published.pdf">11</a>)</sup><br><br>Vaccines containing aluminum have an average of 392mcg of this heavy metal per 0.5mL dose.<sup>(<a href="https://immunize.org/fda/">12</a>)</sup>  That's 31,360x the FDA's maximum safe dose of 25mcg Aluminum per Liter.<sup>(<a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=201.323">13</a>)</sup></p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Squalene</strong><sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html">2</a>)</sup> - An oil usually derived from shark livers.  It's a oil-in-water preparation which is known to invoke strong immune reactions.  Linked to Gulf War Syndrome from the Anthrax Vaccine.<sup>(<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014480099922955">14</a>,<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Shaw2/publication/6682741_Aluminum_Adjuvant_Linked_to_Gulf_War_Illness_Induces_Motor_Neuron_Death_in_Mice/links/0deec521fbfd51c686000000.pdf">15</a>)</sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Preservatives</h4>



<p>In order to prevent vaccines from spoiling while in development or storage, other ingredients are added to act as preservatives.



<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mercury</strong><sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/thimerosal.htm">16</a>)</sup> - The 2nd most toxic element known to man. It's linked to cognitive difficulties, memory and vision loss, fatigue, depression, coordination issues, tremors, skin rashes, mood instability, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Autism, Lupus and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.<sup>(<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1382668905000700">17</a>,<a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/ehp.7743">18</a>,<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-03777-6_1">19</a>,<a href="http://www.nel.edu/userfiles/articlesnew/NEL270406A02.pdf">20</a>,<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Huff2/publication/22815326_Clinical_toxicology_of_mercury/links/55db2b5308aeb38e8a8b54a7.pdf">21</a>)</sup>.  A single does of the influenza vaccine increases a 6 month old's blood mercury levels 39mcg per Liter of blood in their body, and the CDC states that 85mcg per Liter is associated with neurodevelopmental problems.<sup>(<a href="https://immunize.org/fda/#flu">22</a>,<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/Mercury_FactSheet.html">23</a>)</sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Glutaraldehyde</strong><sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf">24</a>)</sup> - Poisonous if ingested, and causes birth defects in animal experiments. Linked to respiratory issues (e.g. asthma) and allergic reactions which worsen with repeated exposure.<sup>(<a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/hospital/hazards/glutaraldehyde/glut.html">25</a>,<a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/9632908">26</a>,<a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/joh/48/2/48_2_75/_pdf">27</a>,<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/tera.1420220108">28</a>)</sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Formaldahyde</strong><sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf">24</a>)</sup> - Known to cause cancer in humans. Damages the respiratory, gastrointestinal, immune, liver, nerve and reproductive systems.<sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/repro/formaldehyde.html">29</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383574211000548">30</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935105802476">31</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0300483X89902138">32</a>,<a href="http://pbmc.ibmc.msk.ru/en/article-en/PBMC-2005-51-1-76/">33</a>,<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.462.8040&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">34</a>,<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-1352-4_3">35</a>)</sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>



<h4>Stabilizers</h4>



<p>Vaccine formulations can change while sitting in storage due to exposure to heat, light, etc.  Stabilizers prevent or slow this type of degradation.</p>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)</strong><sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf">24</a>)</sup><strong> </strong>- An excitotoxin linked to headaches, fatigue, disorientation, heart palpitations and neuron death. Autistic people tend to have high levels of glutamate.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3P6wVUH0pc">9</a>,<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2982.2009.01881.x">36</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0896627395901868">37</a>,<a href="http://www.mpwhi.com/ijc_atrial_fibrillation.pdf">38</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584606002697">39</a>)</sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Polysorbate 80</strong><sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf">24</a>)</sup> - Known to cause reproductive issues and increase susceptibility to oxidative stress.  Carries other toxic ingredients in vaccines across the blood brain barrier.<sup>(<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890623807002432">40</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300483X04004664">41</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539316/#r27">42</a>)</sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>



<h4>Growth Medium</h4>



<p>In order to be used in vaccines, microorganisms must first be grown in big batches.  Here are a few of the ingredients used to host and feed them during this phase of production.</p>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Aborted Human Fetal Tissue</strong><sup>(<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/aborted-fetuses-vaccines/story?id=29005539">43</a>,<a href="https://youtu.be/PN7FQCkiBp8">44</a>)</sup> - A concern for anyone who objects to abortion for moral reasons.  There are also concerns about potential problems caused by injecting foreign DNA fragments into the bloodstream.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyK84PCLVMs">45</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJh3TiCFJH4">46</a>)</sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Animal Blood &amp; Organs</strong><sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf">24</a>)</sup> - A concern for anyone practicing a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle.  Also carries the risk of transmitting diseases such as the cancer causing SV40.<sup>(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10472327/">47</a>)</sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Egg Protein</strong><sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf">24</a>)</sup> - Possibly related to high rates of egg allergies in children since adjuvents cause the immune system to become reactive to all present foreign proteins.<sup>(<a href="https://vaccinesafetycommission.org/pdfs/08-2015-Journal-Food-Allergies.pdf">48</a>)</sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>



<h2>How Many Vaccines Do We Get?</h2>



<p>The number of doses we receive is going to matter when we're talking about injecting potentially toxic materials into our bodies, especially for young children.  Let's take a look at the Center for Disease Control's recommended vaccine schedule.</p>



<h4>The First Year</h4>



<p>Infants in the United States generally receive around 22 vaccine doses in their first year of life, more than any other nation, including the completely unnecessary Hepatitis B vaccine the day they are born.<sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html">49</a>)</sup>  These vaccines are formulated for children 6 years of age, which means these babies are receiving doses designed for someone multiple times their body weight.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8uradn98Ls">50</a>)</sup></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://ipfs.cahlen.org/ipfs/QmSdoirk12PeieqZqh58F6pGegVzXC8nxG9L2K5HfsgLSN" alt="CDC - Vaccine Schedule - Birth to 15 Months" class="wp-image-1261"/></figure>


<p>In the vaccine schedule chart above, taken directly from the Center for Disease Control's website, we can also see that many of the vaccines are administered at the same time, with 6 injections being given at just 2-months of age and 5 more at 4-months of age.<sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html">49</a>)</sup>  Is it surprising that the United States has the worst infant mortality rate of any developed nation?<sup>(<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/08/health/child-mortality-rates-by-country-study-intl/index.html">51</a>)</sup></p>



<h4>The First 18 Years</h4>



<p>The toxic onslaught continues through the rest of childhood with a total of 26 more vaccine injections, including 17 of the mercury-laden influenza vaccine.<sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html">49</a>,<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/thimerosal.htm">16</a>)</sup></p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://ipfs.cahlen.org/ipfs/QmXBsdx35eSKzx3oN4VqHCaeu5pJKERsHJf7UFWVofx6sV" alt="CDC - Vaccine Schedule - First 18 Years" class="wp-image-1262"/></figure>


<p>Prior to 1986 children were only given 11 vaccine doses by their 18th birthday, but that number has now jumped to 48.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJh3TiCFJH4">46</a>,<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html">49</a>)</sup>  It's worth noting here that Chronic Illness in children was only 12.8% before 1986, and jumped to 54.6% by 2017.<sup>(<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/185391">52</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876285910002500">53</a>)</sup> <strong> </strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Is it a coincidence that both childhood vaccine doses and chronic illness rates both increased by 4.3x over the same period of time?  </em></strong></p>



<h2>How is Vaccine Safety Assured?</h2>



<p>As you can see, there are a lot of ingredients in vaccines which should cause us some concern, and young children are getting injected with a large number of these toxin-laced drugs.  Regardless, the pharmaceutical industry, medical community, our governmental regulatory agencies and the mainstream media all assure us vaccines are safe.  Let's take a closer look at these groups and evaluate whether their assurances can be trusted.</p>



<h3>Medical Community</h3>



<p>Doctors are where most of the general population get their assurances that vaccines are safe.  Almost any doctor you ask will tell you that there's no evidence that vaccines cause any harm.  </p>



<p>The truth is there are over a thousand studies demonstrating vaccines cause harm, but the doctors are not aware of this.  They believe vaccines are safe because they are told to believe it by their teachers, employers, the governmental regulatory agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzdH4eRey1U">54</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8uradn98Ls">50</a>)</sup></p>



<p>Keep in mind that doctors go through the same education system as the rest of us which teaches people WHAT to think not HOW to think.  The same is true of medical school.  Doctors believe vaccines are safe because that's what they are told to believe.  Very rarely do doctors have the time or willingness to look into these matters for themselves.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8uradn98Ls">50</a>)</sup></p>



<p>Let's also keep in mind that mistakes made by doctors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States, just under Cancer and Heart Disease.<sup>(<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/22/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-america.html">55</a>)</sup>  Considering their primary oath is, "Do no harm," putting your trust in doctors seems dubious at best.</p>



<h3>Governmental Regulatory Agencies</h3>



<p>Just because doctors blindly trust the information they get regarding vaccine safety from other sources doesn't necessarily mean those other sources are wrong.  So let's take a look at the governmental regulatory agencies giving doctors this information.</p>



<h4>The FDA</h4>



<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the organization that evaluates and licenses drugs to be sold to the general population of the United States.  You can think of them as the first line of defense in protecting the public from drugs which may cause harm.</p>



<p>Normally, a drug company is required to conduct multi-year safety studies before a drug is approved for sale by the FDA.  However, in the case of vaccines the study period is often only a few days.  For example, the Hepatitis B vaccine, which is given to infants on their first day of life, was licensed based on studies only 4-5 days in length, and Polio was licensed after only 2 days.<sup>(<a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/79341/download">56</a>,<a href="https://www.drugs.com/pro/recombivax.html">57</a>,<a href="https://www.drugs.com/pro/ipol.html">58</a>)</sup></p>



<p>Drug safety studies also normally require the use of an experimental group of people, the ones given the drug, and a control group given an inactive substance (i.e. placebo).  After a period of time these two groups are compared statistically to see if the drug caused any increases in health problems.  However, in the case of vaccines, the FDA allows studies to simply compare against another vaccine or a version of the test vaccine with only the microorganism element removed.  This means that vaccines are licensed based on studies which compare the vaccine against injections containing all of the same adjuvents, preservatives and stabilizers discussed above.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJh3TiCFJH4">46</a>,<a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccine/a_license_to_kill.html">59</a>,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111211034812/http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/janak/080723">60</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4157320/">61</a>,<a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JWReportFDAhpvVaccineRecords.pdf">62</a>)</sup></p>



<p>Considering vaccines are often administered 6 at a time in 2-month-olds, you would think there would be a requirement to conduct safety studies where vaccines are given in combination.  Sadly, these tests are never done before a vaccine is licensed by the FDA.<sup>(<a href="https://healthimpactnews.com/2018/robert-f-kennedy-jr-addresses-capitol-hill-on-vaccine-safety-issues/">63</a>)</sup></p>



<p>As if all of that weren't bad enough, the United States Congress investigated the FDA and found that a majority of the members on the committees approving vaccines have financial ties to the vaccine industry.<sup>(<a href="https://www.nvic.org/nvic-archives/conflicts-of-interest.aspx">64</a>)</sup>  In other words, their goal is to sell as many vaccines as possible, not to protect the public.</p>



<h4>The CDC</h4>



<p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is responsible for monitoring the effect of a vaccine on the general population after it's been licensed by the FDA.  They can be thought of as the second line of defense in ensuring vaccines aren't harming people.  </p>



<p>A majority of the CDC's evaluation of vaccine safety is done through statistical evaluations of archived medical data.  Unfortunately, it's very easy to manipulate data to show the results you want them to show.  So the question becomes whether or not the CDC has a history of bias and an incentive to falsify data. </p>



<p>Let's take a look at the vaccine research known as the Danish Studies.  The CDC hired the statistician Poul Thorsen to evaluate a large amount of medical records out of Denmark.  While he was working on this analysis, he allegedly stole over a million dollars of grant money from the CDC, went into hiding and is currently on the FBI's Most Wanted List.<sup>(<a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/fugitives/profiles.asp">65</a>,<a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/advocacy-policy/criminal-conduct-poul-thorsen/">66</a>)</sup>  Yet, to this day his work is considered to be some the strongest evidence we have that vaccines are safe.</p>



<p>Dr. William Thompson, a researcher at the CDC, revealed that he had been instructed in a secret meeting in 2003 to destroy data which showed African American boys were 3.4 times more likely to develop autism if they received the MMR vaccine before they were 36-months old.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4TPe4YI6_4">67</a>)</sup>  Congressman Bill Posey asked Congress to investigate the matter, but Dr. William Thompson has still not been subpoenaed several years later.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxr-cv-JuI8">68</a>)</sup></p>



<p>In the year 2000, the CDC convened an emergency meeting in Simponwood Georgia to discuss how to cover-up results showing that there was a dose dependent reaction to Mercury in vaccines of up to 11 times the number of adverse neurological reactions in children.  In other words, the more mercury a child received, the more likely they were to have serious health problems.<sup>(<a href="http://whale.to/c/Simpsonwood-Documents.pdf">69</a>)</sup>  Still to this day the CDC recommends that everyone receive a yearly flu vaccine containing mercury.</p>



<p>Those are just two of the examples we know about of the CDC coming across results they didn't like and trying to hide them from the public, and there are plenty more examples.  </p>



<p>To make matter worse, there are multiple instances of CDC employees accepting jobs at vaccine corporations upon leaving.  One of these people is Julie Gerberdine, the Director of the CDC from 2002-2009, who took a job as the President of the Vaccine Division at Merck upon leaving the CDC, and made 2.34 Million Dollars selling 38,368 shares of Merck stock.<sup>(<a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/special-report/julie-gerberding-merck-vaccines">70</a>,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/310158/000122520815011802/xslF345X01/doc4.xml">71</a>)</sup> Considering the CDC is supposed to be policing the vaccine industry, this type of revolving door situation is a major red flag for collusion.</p>



<p>It's worth mentioning that the CDC holds several patents for vaccines, which means they receive money for every sale.<sup>(<a href="https://www.lawfirms.com/resources/environment/environment-health/cdc-members-own-more-50-patents-connected-vaccinations">72</a>)</sup>  Also, the largest portion of the CDC's budget is for purchasing, promoting and selling vaccines.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJh3TiCFJH4">46</a>)</sup>  In other words, their priority is the sale of vaccines, not the verification of their safety.</p>



<p>If the CDC really wanted to be sure that vaccines weren't causing any health problems, they would run a simple statistical analysis comparing vaccinated vs. unvaccinated children.  The CDC has never done this type of analysis despite the The Institute of Medicine stating that they could easily do so using the medical records in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD).<sup>(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK206938/">73</a>)</sup>  They also admit that they have never studied the long-term effects of receiving multiple vaccines at once.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJh3TiCFJH4">46</a>)</sup></p>



<h3>Pharmaceutical Industry</h3>



<p>If doctors get their vaccine safety beliefs from the FDA and CDC, and both of those organizations appear to have conflicts of interest, engage in collusion with and have a bias for drug companies, our next step is to evaluate whether the industry itself can be trusted.</p>



<p>Perhaps you've heard the meme that if corporations were people they'd be psychopaths.<sup>(<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/our-humanity-naturally/201103/why-corporations-are-psychotic">74</a>)</sup>  This makes sense considering their primary goal is to make their shareholders money.  Let's take a look at a couple of examples of this type of destructive behavior in two of the primary vaccine manufacturers.</p>



<p>In 1999, the FDA approved the drug Vioxx for arthritis based on safety studies the pharmaceutical company Merck submitted.  These studies included data showing that Vioxx reduced heart attack risk, but in a later lawsuit it was revealed that their data actually showed it doubled the risk, and that Merck knew about this.  This dishonesty in the name of maximizing profits caused at least 100,000 heart attacks and 55,000 premature deaths.  An internal company email revealed in the lawsuit had the following response for how to handle doctors who were becoming suspicious of the drug's safety: "We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live."<sup>(<a href="https://www.news.com.au/news/drug-company-drew-up-doctor-hit-list/news-story/eb55ca36e081d497730629e6c8559abf">75</a>,<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6918-up-to-140000-heart-attacks-linked-to-vioxx/">76</a>,<a href="https://healthimpactnews.com/2011/merck-pleads-guilty-to-criminal-charge-and-pays-950-million-fine-for-vioxx/">77</a>)</sup></p>



<p>Another example of this type of psychopathic behavior is the story of the Pluserix vaccine by GlaxoSmithKline which contained the Urabe strain of Mumps.  The company had to stop selling the product in Canada because it was giving kids meningitis, which can result in brain damage and/or death.  Knowing full well the dangers, they turned around and marketed the vaccine to the UK government, which led to the exact same result. They then went through the entire cycle one more time in Brazil all in the name of profit.<sup>(<a href="http://whale.to/vaccine/mmr15.html">78</a>)</sup></p>



<p>Normally this type of behavior would be mitigated through legal liability.  If all a corporation cares about is profit, then the only way to keep them in line is the ability to sue them for harm caused.  Unfortunately, in 1986 the United States federal government passed a law protecting vaccines companies from all litigation<sup>(<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-bill/5546">79</a>)</sup>.  That's right, if you or your child is injured by a vaccine you cannot sue the manufacturer.</p>



<h4>Mainstream &amp; Social Media</h4>



<p>If doctors get their information from the FDA and CDC, and those organizations are effectively just appeasing the pharmaceutical industry, and the criminal justice system refuses to protect us, what else is left?  Ideally the final level of protection would be journalists, but mainstream media gets up to 70% of their advertising income from pharmaceutical companies.<sup>(<a href="https://www.sott.net/article/347535-Revolution-for-Truth-Rally-Robert-F-Kennedy-Jr-exposes-corporate-media-censorship">80</a>)</sup>  It's not likely they'd risk losing that income, which would probably put them out of business, by reporting on issues concerning vaccine safety.</p>



<p>Even social media sites are preventing the public from informing their friends and family about potential vaccine safety issues.  Facebook reduces the ranking of "anti-vaccine" videos, and does not allow for people to advertise their posts.<sup>(<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-anti-vaccine-crack-down/">81</a>)</sup> YouTube does not allow its user to monetize any videos raising concerns over vaccine safety.<sup>(<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-anti-vaccination-videos-monetize-2019-2">82</a>)</sup></p>



<p>If it's really the case that vaccines are safe, then why are people trying so hard to prevent conversation about it?  Shouldn't the truth be able to stand on its own?</p>



<h2>What are the Dangers of Vaccines?</h2>



<p>As you can see, there are a lot of reasons to doubt we can trust the people assuring us vaccines are safe.  Just because our watchdogs are sleeping on the job still doesn't mean vaccines aren't safe, so let's sample some of problems with vaccines we're able to learn from more independent sources.</p>



<h4>Vaccine Safety Research</h4>



<p>I'll start off by mentioning that Neil Z. Miller, a medical research journalist, has been looking into the vaccine issue for over 30 years.<sup>(<a href="http://thinktwice.com/Neil_Z_Miller_CV-Bio.pdf">83</a>)</sup>  He reports that there are 1000s of published peer-reviewed scientific articles which call vaccine safety into question.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzdH4eRey1U">54</a>)</sup>  He provides brief summaries of 400 of the most important of these in his book, "<em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Millers-Review-Critical-Vaccine-Studies/dp/188121740Xen.org/MillersReview">Miller's Review of Critical Vaccine Studies</a></em>."  When your doctor tells you there's no evidence vaccines are unsafe, you may want to point them towards this book.</p>



<h4>The VAERS Database</h4>



<p>Health and Human Services (HHS), the parent organization of the CDC and FDA, maintains a database containing all reported cases of vaccines causing harm called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).<sup>(<a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/">84</a>)</sup>  In 2016 alone there were 59,000 reported negative reactions to vaccines, including 10,000 emergency room visits, 1000 permanent disabilities and 432 deaths.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJh3TiCFJH4">46</a>)</sup></p>



<p>For something that the regulatory agencies claim is safe, that is a lot of harm to be occurring in a single year.  Even worse, it is well known that adverse events are underreported to the VAERS database, with estimates of less that 1% of events being reported.<sup>(<a href="https://healthit.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf">85</a>,<a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/dataguide.html">86</a>,<a href="https://healthit.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf">85</a>)</sup>  1000 life-long disabilities and 432 death per year seems like a lot to me, and the under-reporting estimates mean those could potentially be 100x higher than that.</p>



<p>The reason for under-reporting is that it's a manual process.  Doctors are required by law to submit a report for every instance, but very few actually do.  To solve this problem, the CDC worked with Harvard Pilgrim Health Care to create an automated reporting system using the medical records of their patients.  The system ensured that a majority of adverse events were captured, and the results revealed that 2.6% of vaccine injections resulted in harm to the patient.<sup>(<a href="https://healthit.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf">85</a>)</sup>  Considering the childhood vaccine schedule the CDC recommends includes 48 doses, every single child is practically guaranteed to experience at least one adverse event before they turn 18.</p>



<p>After having invested so much into testing the automated VAERS database, and it being such a success, you'd think the CDC would have immediately begun making efforts to implement the system nationwide.  Unfortunately, in their report Harvard Pilgrim states that the CDC dropped the program and ceased responding to their repeated inquiries on how to proceed.<sup>(<a href="https://healthit.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf">85</a>)</sup>  This is sadly consistent with the CDC's history of choosing to hide data unfavorable to vaccines from the public.</p>



<h4>Vaccine Injury Court</h4>



<p>Due to the high number of lawsuits vaccine manufacturers were experiencing, they notified the federal government that they would discontinue production unless something was done to protect them.  In response, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 was passed.  This made the vaccine manufacturers immune to legal responsibility for harm caused, and created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to provide financial support to victims who were no longer able to sue the corporations.<sup>(<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-bill/5546">79</a>,<a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html">87</a>)</sup></p>



<p>This compensation program, often referred to as Vaccine Injury Court, provides no judge, jury, or legal discovery and does not allow the press to monitor its proceedings.  Victims must prove to a "Special Master" that it was the vaccine which caused the damage using accepted scientific studies, the kind that are generally funded by the CDC and tend to leave out negative results.  Nearly all cases are thrown out, and even if the Special Master decides compensation is appropriate, there is a cap of $250,000.<sup>(<a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html">87</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJh3TiCFJH4">46</a>)</sup>.  </p>



<p>Despite how difficult it is to prove your case and get compensation, the court has still paid out over $4,000,000,000 of taxpayer's money since its creation.<sup>(<a href="https://www.salon.com/2018/12/23/federal-vaccine-court-quietyly-pays-out-billins_partner/">88</a>)</sup></p>



<h4>The Austism Epidemic</h4>



<p>While far from the only example of potential damage caused by vaccines, Autism is probably the most well known among the general public.  The CDC tell us unequivocally that Vaccines do not cause Autism, so why is there so much concern about it?<sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html">89</a>)</sup>  To understand this, we must examine the history of Autism.  </p>



<p>The disorder now known as Autism first appeared shortly after the introduction of Pertussis vaccine, and was described as a set of symptoms that the medical community had never seen before.  In the early days it tended appear most in the children of wealthier parents, the kind of people more likely to be able to afford vaccination.  When socioeconomic disparities began to disappear and vaccines became accessible to everyone, Autism began to more evenly effect all levels of society.<sup>(<a href="https://www.educate-yourself.org/vcd/vcdautismamystery.shtml">90</a>)</sup></p>



<p>Populations which tend not to vaccinate their children have extremely low to non-existent rates of Autism.  For example, in 2005 an examination of an Amish community in Pennsylvania who tended not to vaccinate their children was done.  Given the population and Autism rates at the time, there should have been over 100 children in their community with the disorder.  Only 4 were found, and the element common to each of them was vaccination.<sup>(<a href="https://www.putchildrenfirst.org/media/e.4.pdf">91</a>)</sup></p>



<p>Dr. Bernadine Healy, former Director of the National Institute of Health, was asked in the interview below what she thought of the theory of a link between vaccines and autism:</p>


<iframe id="odysee-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://odysee.com/$/embed/@VaxxedWorld:d/NIH-Director-Dr--Bernadine-Healy-speaks-to-Sharyl-Attkisson-about-autism-susceptibility:e?r=3ZZs282SEQ5uPABXhMcHRGGB6RSiG4Ar" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>In summary, she states that we simply have not done the research necessary to determine the matter one way or the other.  So how can the CDC be so confident in its declaration that Vaccines don't cause Autism?</p>



<p>Autism rates have been skyrocketing for years, with current estimates saying that 1 in 36 children have autism.  If the current trends continue, 1 in 2 children will be Autistic by 2032.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJh3TiCFJH4">46</a>)</sup>  Considering Autism appeared around the same time as vaccines were becoming more commonly administered, and the rates are increasing alongside the number of vaccines we give children, shouldn't we be concerned that one of the most likely culprits has not actually been sufficiently studied?</p>



<h4>Comparing Vaccinated &amp; Unvaccinated Children</h4>



<p>The Institute of Medicine says no large-scale studies have ever compared the health outcomes of entirely unvaccinated populations to vaccinated.<sup>(<a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/13563/chapter/2?term=%22no+studies+have+compared%22#5">92</a>,<a href="https://healthimpactnews.com/2018/robert-f-kennedy-jr-addresses-capitol-hill-on-vaccine-safety-issues/">63</a>)</sup>  This is a result of the agencies with the financial ability to conduct such large and intensive studies refusing to do so.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJh3TiCFJH4">46</a>)</sup>  However, we do have some smaller more independent studies which give us a sense for the results we'd see if the CDC would do its job.</p>



<p>For example, in 2017 there was a study of homeschoolers comparing the health outcomes of those who had been vaccinated and those who hadn't.  The results showed that while vaccinated children were less likely to get the diseases the vaccines target, they were more likely to have the following ailments: Allergies (30x), Learning Disabilities (5x), Austism (4x), ADHD (4x), Neurological Disorders (4x) and Eczema (3x).<sup>(<a href="https://antivakcina.org/files/MawsonStudyHealthOutcomes5.8.2017.pdf">93</a>)</sup></p>



<p>Considering the ailments the vaccines aim to prevent are generally mild and temporary, while the other issues they appear to cause are fairly severe and last a lifetime, are the vaccines really worth it?</p>



<h4>Parent Reports of Vaccine Damaged Children</h4>



<p>Countless parents have been telling the same story over the last few decades.  Their child was happy, healthy and thriving, and then they got a vaccine and suddenly they were severely disabled in one way or another.  <a href="https://youtu.be/jFFp_b2UnTI?list=PLl4lfKCGhLmx9hCO2ss6A8Zq-GubrvR0_">Here is a playlist</a> containing over a hundred videos of these types of stories.</p>



<p>Their stories are discounted by the medical community, but can so many similar stories be coincidence?  What about the story of the perfectly healthy triplets who all came down with autism after receiving the same vaccine on the same day? </p>


<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPHZFQFpZrY","type":"video","providerNameSlug":"youtube","className":"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"} -->

<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->


<p>The chances of three perfectly healthy children in the same family randomly happening to come down with autism on the same day are astronomically low.</p>



<h4>Unintentional Contamination</h4>



<p>Vaccines are often contaminated with other unintentional viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms resulting from the use of animal and aborted fetal tissue as growth mediums.  These have various effects such as inducing abortion or causing dementia, but most are not even known about and therefore completely unstudied.</p>



<p>A major example this is Simian Virus 40 (SV40) which contaminated the Polio Vaccine between 1955 and 1961.  Over 98 million people were injected with this virus.  A study discovered that the people who received this vaccine are significantly more likely to develop four different types of cancer, including a 90% increased chance to develop mesothelioma.<sup>(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10472327/">47</a>)</sup></p>



<h4>DTP Vaccine Increases Overall Mortality</h4>



<p>Dr. Peter Aaby, who founded the Bandim Health Project in West Africa in 1978, ran an analysis of overall mortality rates in children who had and had not received the DTP Vaccine.  He found that while there was a decrease in the diseases the vaccine targets, overall mortality of these children was 5-10x higher than children who didn't receive the vaccine.  This means that for some unknown reason, children who received the DTP vaccine were much more likely to die of other causes.<sup>(<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396417300464">94</a>)</sup></p>



<h4>Chickenpox Vaccine Increases Shingles Rates</h4>



<p>While working as a researcher at the CDC, Dr. Gary Goldman discovered that the while the Chickenpox Vaccine did decrease rates of Chickenpox, it increased the rate of Shingles.  Normally an illness that occurs in old age, he also discovered that Shingles was occurring in children who had the vaccine at alarming rates.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9owLjgItcJU">95</a>)</sup></p>



<p>When he went to publish the results, the CDC only allowed him to present the portion showing that Chickenpox rates were reduced, but not the information about increases in Shingles.  He quit the CDC as a result, and had to overcome a legal Cease and Desist from the CDC before he was able to publish his results.<sup>(<a href="https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/leadership/gary-goldman-phd/">96</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3759842/">97</a>)</sup></p>



<h4>The Devastating HPV Vaccine</h4>



<p>In 2006, the FDA approved the vaccine known as Gardasil which targets HPV.  By 2008 the FDA had received more than 8000 reports of serious injury and death resulting from the vaccine.  Keep in mind that adverse reactions are under-reported roughly 100:1.   These injuries include, but are not limited to paralysis, loss of consciousness, seizures, convulsions, kidney failure, arthritis, menstrual irregularities and miscarriages.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZQEUd9Nc7E">98</a>,<a href="http://www.whale.to/c/hpv_vaccines.html">99</a>)</sup>  Japan removed the HPV Vaccine from its recommended schedule because of the large number of serious events.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8uradn98Ls">50</a>)</sup></p>



<h4>Vaccines Sterilizing Girls in Africa</h4>



<p>In 2014 there was a campaign to provide free Tetanus vaccination to people in Kenya.  It was later discovered that only women of child-bearing ages were receiving the vaccine.  When people began to suspect something was amiss, they snuck samples of the vaccine to two different labs, and both confirmed the presence of Beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (b-HCG), a compound which sterilizes women.<sup>(<a href="http://www.kccb.or.ke/home/news-2/press-statement-5/">100</a>,<a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/mass-sterilization-kenyan-doctors-find-anti-fertility-agent-in-un-tetanus-vaccine/5431664">101</a>,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2665354">102</a>)</sup></p>



<p>When a population becomes so trusting of their governments that they'll allow them to inject them with whatever it wishes, this is the type of thing that can happen.  The United States is on a fast track to this level of complacency.</p>



<h4>Vaccine Shedding</h4>



<p>Vaccines which use live versions of a virus have the potential to "shed" from the individual for days, weeks or months after injection.  This means that the individual is actually able to infect other people with the virus.<sup>(<a href="https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2019/07/23/what-is-vaccine-shedding.aspx">103</a>)</sup></p>



<h4>Vaccines Causes More Dangerous Strains</h4>



<p>Perhaps you're familiar with the problem antibiotics are having these days as bacteria become more resistant to them the more they are used.<sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/threats-report/2019-ar-threats-report-508.pdf">104</a>)</sup>  People are less familiar with the fact that a similar problem occurs with vaccines.  Not only that, but this process makes the microorganisms we are fighting actually more dangerous than they otherwise would have been.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzdH4eRey1U">54</a>)</sup></p>



<p>So the more we use the vaccines the closer we get to a world where they no longer work, possibly leaving us with versions of diseases which are more likely to cause serious harm.</p>



<h2>Do Vaccines work?</h2>



<p>Now that we've discussed some of the potential hazards, lack of adequate safety studies, and instances of collusion and conflict of interest between the industry and governmental agencies, let's discuss the actual efficacy of the common vaccines at preventing the diseases they target so that we can evaluate whether or not they are worth the risks.</p>



<h4>Flu Vaccine</h4>



<p>In 2018-19 the Flu Vaccine was 29% effective for the strains it targeted, and only 14% effective for people above the age of 50.  It was only 9% effective against the most common strain during this period of time.<sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/2018-2019.html">105</a>)</sup> </p>



<h4>Polio Vaccine</h4>



<p>The first Polio vaccine more than doubled infection rates after it was introduced in the 1950s.  Before the vaccine was licensed Polio was already on the decline, with death rates dropping 50% between 1923 and 1953.  Cases continued to drop drastically on the same decline they were experiencing before the vaccine, including in countries which opted not to vaccinate their citizens.<sup>(<a href="http://whale.to/vaccines/polio.html">106</a>)</sup></p>



<p>Nearly all the cases of Polio in the United States between 1961 and 2000 were due to the live virus present in the vaccine itself which caused the recipient to spread the disease to others.  There have been no cases of Polio since it was switched to an inactive virus version of the vaccine.<sup>(<a href="https://www.who.int/features/qa/64/en/">107</a>,<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/14/2/568/299427">108</a>)</sup></p>



<h4>Measles Vaccine</h4>



<p>The incidence of Measles dropped drastically after the introduction of the vaccine.<sup>(<a href="https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/graph-us-measles-cases">109</a>,<a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/1766702">110</a>)</sup>  However, by that time the severity of the illness had already decreased from thousands of deaths per million in the mid 1800s to as low as 1 death per million (far less dangerous than the common flu is today) in Scandinavia as a result of improved health and hygiene before the vaccine was even available.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzdH4eRey1U">54</a>)</sup>.  In the United States the severity of the disease dropped by 95% between 1920 and 1960 before the vaccine was introduced.<sup>(<a href="https://www.nvic.org/vaccines-and-diseases/Measles/measles-history-in-america.aspx">111</a>)</sup></p>



<p>Outbreaks of Measles in recent years affected vaccinated people as well, usually making up a majority of those infected.<sup>(<a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.77.4.434">112</a>,<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm198703263161303">113</a>,<a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/129/1/173/58793">114</a>)</sup></p>



<h4>Chickenpox Vaccine</h4>



<p>The Chickenpox Vaccine has been shown to be about 90% effective over a period of about 14 years.<sup>(<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/203/3/312/2192149">115</a>,<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/198218">116</a>)</sup>  However, it nearly doubles the incidence of Shingles, an illness caused by the same virus.  It also increases the incidence of Shingles in children, normally something which occurs only in adulthood, by 3-6 times.  Considering the medical costs associated with Shingles are 3 times that of Chickenpox, the value of the vaccine should be called into question.<sup>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9owLjgItcJU">95</a>)</sup></p>



<h4>Pertussis Vaccine</h4>



<p>The Pertussis Vaccine protects against Whooping Cough at rates between 44% and 80%.<sup>(<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/397408">117</a>)</sup>  However, it's efficacy drops off very quickly over a short period requiring frequent re-vaccinations.<sup>(<a href="https://journals.lww.com/pidj/fulltext/2005/05001/duration_of_immunity_against_pertussis_after.11.as">118</a>,<a href="https://sharylattkisson.com/2019/10/whooping-cough-outbreak-among-vaccinated-in-california-la-times/">119</a>)</sup>  A majority of cases of Whooping Cough occur in vaccinated populations.<sup>(<a href="https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2016/01/26/whooping-cough-vaccine-ineffective.aspx">120</a>,<a href="https://sharylattkisson.com/2019/10/whooping-cough-outbreak-among-vaccinated-in-california-la-times/">119</a>)</sup>  Despite over 50 years of vaccination, infection rates for Whooping Cough are on the rise.<sup>(<a href="http://www.bu.edu/articles/2018/whooping-cough-on-the-rise/">121</a>)</sup></p>



<h4>Mumps Vaccine</h4>



<p>Estimates of Mumps Vaccine efficacy range anywhere from 37% to 85%.<sup>(<a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/121/4/593/147893">122</a>)</sup>  Outbreaks of Mumps has been occurring regularly in vaccinated populations since the mid 1990s.<sup>(<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X04001331">123</a>)</sup>  Also, two former Merck employees filed a lawsuit against the manufacturer of the vaccine stating that it had falsified data in order to make it appear more effective than it was, and that the low efficacy of the drug was known internally before licensing.<sup>(<a href="https://ahrp.org/former-merck-scientists-sue-merck-alleging-mmr-vaccine-efficacy-fraud/">124</a>)</sup></p>



<h4>HPV Vaccine</h4>



<p>The Gardasil Vaccine targets 4 of the over 150 HPV strains.  2 of the strains it targets are known to cause cervical cancer in later life, but there are 13 other cancer causing strains it doesn't address.<sup>(<a href="http://www.whale.to/c/hpv_vaccines.html">99</a>,<a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JWReportFDAhpvVaccineRecords.pdf">62</a>)</sup> There is no evidence that the vaccine prevents these types of cancers, or that any immunity it might provide lasts until the age of 50 when these types of cancers begin to appear.<sup>(<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/07853890.2011.645353">125</a>,<a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JWReportFDAhpvVaccineRecords.pdf">62</a>)</sup></p>



<p>It is primarily administered to children between the ages of 9 and 18.<sup>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2019/p0822-cancer-prevented-vaccine.html">126</a>)</sup>  When administered to individuals already infected with HPV it can increase the severity of the condition, and can even infect some people with the virus who had never been exposed.<sup>(<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/07853890.2011.645353">125</a>,<a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JWReportFDAhpvVaccineRecords.pdf">62</a>)</sup>  </p>



<h3>What About Herd Immunity?</h3>



<p>Herd Immunity is a term used by advocates of vaccines to justify forcing the unwilling to vaccinate themselves in order to protect the population at large.  However, it's important to note that term has been repurposed from the original definition, and is actually impossible through the use of vaccines due to the short lifespan of immunity they provide.</p>



<p>True herd immunity is when a future mother gets infected and gains immunity naturally gives that immunity to her child in utero and through breast feeding. As that gifted immunity wanes it is boosted by older children in the community having the illness and giving the young child light exposure (much like a vaccination). The child will therefore get the illness with all of its symptoms at an older age when it is something their body can deal with, and in the case of a female start the cycle all over again. Vaccinations actually sabotage this cycle, and make it more likely that children get illnesses at younger more dangerous ages.<sup>(<a href="https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2019/03/12/vaccine-herd-immunity.aspx">127</a>,<a href="https://youtu.be/Vlqyj_uyzBc">128</a>)</sup></p>



<p>Herd immunity through vaccination is an entirely different process. There are many reasons this doesn't work which are discussed in the article (e.g. vaccines are only marginally effective, diseases mutate and vaccines are too specific to deal with this, vaccine immunity is short-lived compared to immunity through natural exposure, etc.).<sup>(<a href="http://www.h4cblog.com/vaccines-and-the-myth-of-herd-immunity">129</a>,<a href="http://whale.to/c/herd_immunity.html">130</a>,<a href="https://youtu.be/Vlqyj_uyzBc">128</a>)</sup> The main issue with advocating herd immunity through vaccination is that it requires one take the stance that you have the right to force medicate the unwilling, which is a violation of human rights, and has been used for bad purposes in the past.</p>



<h2>Are Vaccines Safe &amp; Effective?</h2>



<p>We've examined the toxic contents of vaccines, the dubious behavior of the vaccine industry and governmental agencies, the numerous examples of serious harm caused to hundreds of thousands of people, and the mediocre efficacy of vaccines still administered and recommended to this day.  In conclusion, can we say that vaccines are both safe and effective?</p>



<p>My personal answer to the question is no, and I have no intention of vaccinating my future children.  However, despite all of these factors, there are likely some situations where vaccination is the right thing to do, and I believe it is every parent's right to make that decision for themselves.</p>



<p>I am deeply concerned about the efforts of the Vaccine Industry and CDC to systematically erode our rights to choose not to vaccinate.  Lobbyists are working tirelessly to remove exemptions allowing children to attend school without getting all of the vaccines recommended in the vaccine schedule, and there are plans to require adults to be vaccinated in order to board airplanes or even to be in public spaces.</p>


<p>These efforts to force inject every citizen of the United States will only succeed as a result of a lack of information.  So, if you found this article helpful, I ask that you please share it with someone you care about.</p>

description: Today I'll be showing you my new straw bale house on the side of a supervolcano.  I'll also discuss Trusts and how the government tricks us into giving up our natural rights and becoming members of a corporate feudalism.  Finally, I'll discuss whether or not any form of animal husbandry can be ethical.

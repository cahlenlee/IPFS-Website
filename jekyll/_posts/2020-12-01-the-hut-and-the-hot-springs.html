description: This is the first episode of a new series I'm starting called Wizard's Log, which essentially just a journal entry or life update. In this entry, I talk a bit about my living situation and my plans for the future, and also tell you about my recent camping trip in freezing temperatures. Luckily I was camped near a hot spring!

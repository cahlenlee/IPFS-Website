description: I've been having a lot of issues with flat tires while riding around on my Fat Tire Solar eBike in the Southwest United States, and have been experimenting with ways to solve the problem. In this video I demonstrate how I converted my tires to a tubeless puncture resistant setup, despite the fact that my rims are not tubeless ready, by cutting open a tube to be used as a rim liner.

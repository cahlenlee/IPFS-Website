description: A question I often get from people in all areas of my life is some variation of, "Are you a Christian?" The answer depends largely how you define the term.

<p>The Bible contains some amount of truth, but that does not mean it's the only source or even the best source of truth. Also, the translated Bible uses the word "God" to mean several different things, so the untranslated usage is going to be important for understanding each context.</p>

<p>As for Jesus, there's no way to know for sure that he ever really existed. While there are many things he reportedly said and did which I do not resonate with, there are others which I do. So you see, it's not so simple of a question to answer.</p>

<p>I am curious if after watching this video you would consider me a Christian or not. Please let me know in the comments.</p>

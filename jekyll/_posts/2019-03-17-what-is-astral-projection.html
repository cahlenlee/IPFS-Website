description: Astral Projection is moving one's center of awareness to locations outside of their physical body allowing them to witness events in other locations. The evidence for its existence is overwhelming in my opinion. Unfortunately it is largely used for nefarious purposes by those who wish to hide the truth from the masses in order to maintain a power differential.

<p>A word of warning to those seeking to Astral Project, or hoping to gain other "magical" abilities. If you seek these things out of a desire for power, you are defining yourself as powerless likely due to fear or trauma. If you proceed without addressing those internal issues first you are likely to bring harm to yourself and others.</p>

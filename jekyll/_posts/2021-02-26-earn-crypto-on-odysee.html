description: <a href="https://odysee.com">Odysee.com</a> is a video hosting platform running on the <a href="https://lbry.com/">LBRY Blockchain</a> which allows you to earn cryptocurrency (LBC) by uploading, watching and interacting with content. I have a fairly small channel, and am still able to feed myself solely from what I earn on the platform.

description: I suspect that things are going to get very dicey in the world in a matter of days. I encourage all of you prepare for the worst in any way that you are able to. I hope I am wrong, but we are likely to experience war, power outage, food shortages and economic collapse (among other things) very shortly here which may lasts for months or years.

<p>I hope I'm wrong, and will continue to try to communicate with you throughout what is to come. The best way to stay connected to me will be through my website (<a href="https://cahlen.org">https://cahlen.org</a>) and my new Telegram page (<a href="https://t.me/CahlenLee">https://t.me/CahlenLee</a>). </p>

<p>Stay strong and don't give into evil. I wish you all the best.</p>

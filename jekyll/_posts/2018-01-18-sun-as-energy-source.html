description: The Sun is so amazing! I'm able to run all kinds of energy intensive things while living in my truck in the desert off of a single 100-Watt Solar Panel and a couple of batteries. The Sun also powers the life of the plants on this planet and even animals like us.

It just feels so right!</p>

description: Today I'm giving a tour of the Bodhi Manda Zen Center in Jemez Springs, NM. I stayed here for almost a year about 15 years ago with the intention of becoming a Zen Buddhist Monk. Life had others plans for me, but since it was nearby I decided to drop by and see how things were going.

<p>One of the coolest things about this place is the fact that it is located on the side of an old volcano and has very hot water flowing just below the surface. This allows them to fill their beautiful geothermal Hot Springs and to heat all of their buildings.</p>

<p>I've been here over a month, and have been offered a position managing the office. It's a tempting offer, especially because of the great community, though I have some other exiting options to consider as well. I'll talk about that in a future video and keep you posted on what I decide.</p>

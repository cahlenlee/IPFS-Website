description: This Solar eBike is a converted RadRover, an electric bike sold by Rad Power Bikes, designed for long-term survival situations. The custom-built expanded battery pack allows me to travel 40-50 miles in a single charge, while the solar panels allow me to recharge the bike while I'm hanging out in the wilderness.

<p>The front and back containers sitting on the racks can hold roughly a month's worth of food, reducing the number of times I need to risk going into populated areas during a crisis. The electric motor runs almost silently, making it easy to get around without being noticed.</p>

<p>I plan to do a video showing you how to build this step-by-step sometime in the future. In the meantime, let me know if you have any questions.</p>

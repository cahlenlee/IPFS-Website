description: Today I'll be trying something new by starting a public video dream journal. I was inspired to do this by some very vivid dreams I had last night triggered by Lion's Mane mushroom extract.

<p>This dream was about a journey to a Native American pueblo hidden deep in the mountains of the American southwest. The people there were almost entirely separated from the outside world, lived without western technology and were the happiest people on Earth due to their lives consisting almost entirely of interactions with their families and local community. </p>

<p>If I continue to have vivid dreams using Lion's Mane, I'll be posting more dream journal videos in the future. </p>

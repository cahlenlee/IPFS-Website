<p>His theory explains physics and the universe in terms of male and female energy, and their desire to be near and stimulated by each other. From the tiniest atom to the largest "black hole" the same interactions and activities are taking place. If we understand it at one level, we can understand it at all levels - "As above, so below"</p>

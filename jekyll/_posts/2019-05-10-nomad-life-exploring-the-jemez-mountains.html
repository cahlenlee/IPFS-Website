description: Today I set out on foot exploring the Jemez Mountains for a week. This area is actually on the side of an active Super Volcano called the Valles Calderas, one of the biggest volcanoes is the world. My goal is to reach a river valley many miles away on the other side of a mesa made of solidified ash.

<p>If things go really well I'll visit a hot springs and the crater itself before I head home in a week, but this first video is about climbing the mesa and exploring the area near the top edge. I came across some native ruins and some abandoned log cabins near an old quarry.</p>

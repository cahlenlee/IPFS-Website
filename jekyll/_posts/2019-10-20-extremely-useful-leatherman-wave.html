description: On this episode of Wizard Gear Iâ€™ll be showing you my Leatherman Wave multi-tool, and talking about many of its different functions. Of all the tools I keep on me while trekking and living in the wilds, the Leatherman Wave is the last one I would give up. It serves so many purposes that I end up using it multiple times a day, and feel naked without it.

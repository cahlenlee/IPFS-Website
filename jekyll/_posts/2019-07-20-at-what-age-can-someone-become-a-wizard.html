description: Today on Ask Cahlen I will be answering the question, "At what age can someone become a wizard?" The answer to this question is largely dependent on what someone considers a wizard to be, so I will provide my definition.  A wizard is someone who has committed themselves to seeking truth, using it wisely and sharing it with others who have made the same commitments.

<p>With that definition in mind, I would say most people would need to be adults before they have the necessary understanding and experience needed in order to understand what they were doing when making those commitments.  However, I image there are rare individuals who are able to do so in childhood.</p>

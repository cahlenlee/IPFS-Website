description: I'm on my way back South for the Winter. Seattle is great during the Summer, but it's hard to resist the call of the Arizona deserts when the rains of the Pacific Northwest set in.  One of my first stops was in the wilds of Nevada. A lone road stretches for miles through the middle of nowhere. I pull off into the brush to rest for the night, and do a little exploring before I retire.

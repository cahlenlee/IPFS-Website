description: Today on Ask Cahlen I'll be answering the question, "What is Open Source Software?" Open Source Software are applications you can run on your PC or Smartphone which make their code available to the public. This allows you to verify they are secure and to modify them to suit your needs. In most cases they are also free to use!

description: A friend has been recommending I explore the Gila National Forest in New Mexico for awhile now, and I finally got the chance.  I'm glad I did because there was so much to see! Come along as Jeremiah the Nomad Man and I explore this area for the first time on our bikes.

<h3><div>The Camp Site</div></h3>

<p>The Gila National Forest is a huge area in western New Mexico and eastern Arizona.&nbsp; The spot we explored was on the far eastern side, accessed by a narrow forested road that went on for miles.&nbsp; I setup camp in a nice open area to maximize the amount of sun my solar panels absorb throughout the day.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Solar eBike</h3>

<p>While exploring on foot can be fun, we can cover much more ground on our bikes.&nbsp; I used my <a href="https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radrover-electric-fat-bike">Rad Rover eBike</a> that I'd modified to be charged through my Solar Panels.&nbsp; I love being propelled by the sun! The bike has fat tires which are perfect for rolling over the rocks, sticks and ice puddles which cover the road.</p>

<h3>The Nomad Man's Bike</h3>

<p>Jeremiah used his <a href="https://motoped.com/survival/">Motoped Survival</a> bike.&nbsp; It's a bicycle with pedals and everything, but it also has a small gas motor which shoots you off like a rocket!&nbsp; The gas tank holds enough fuel to go roughly 80 miles before refueling.</p>

<p>We picked this beauty up at an auction in the middle of nowhere with only 500 miles on it for way less than it sells for new.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Water Tank</h3>

<p>Not far from camp we found an old water tank that was once powered by a towering windmill.&nbsp; The wind doesn't appear to turn the motor these days, but water is still being pumped up from the ground via two large solar panels someone installed recently.</p>

<p>Tanks like this can be found throughout public land in the southeastern United States to water cattle which roam in these areas.</p>

<h3>Rock Art</h3>

<p>We quickly came upon signs indicating this area had been populated by indigenous people at one time.&nbsp; The Rock Art in the photo above is the first instance of these paintings we found, and we found plenty more in the area.</p>

<h3>A Tiny Cave</h3>

<p>Not far from the Rock Art above we found this little square hole in the rock.&nbsp; Upon closer examination it turned out to be a little cave with enough room to have a fire and sleep.&nbsp; I imagine this was like a room for a teenager whose family slept in the larger nearby caves.</p>

<h3>Two Large Caves</h3>

<p>These two caves are much larger than the one just mentioned.&nbsp; One appeared to be something like a master bedroom, while the other seemed to me like a living room with a rock shelf functioned similarly to a couch.&nbsp; The inhabitants had stacked up smaller rocks outside the caves to better define their space and protect it from invaders.</p>

<h3>A Deep Mine</h3>

<p>While driving through the forest Jeremiah spotted a hill of shale.&nbsp; He recognized this as a tell-tale sign of a mine, so we explored further and discovered this entrance right beneath the roots of a large tree.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We explored a little ways into the entrance, but it appeared to go very deep and we had not brought our flashlights.&nbsp; We intended to come back the next morning and explore, but we both independently experienced some foreboding signs that evening, and decided against it.</p>

<h3>Small Waterfall and Pool</h3>

<p>I'm always on the lookout for good places to setup camp for weeks at a time, and this little waterfall flowing into a pool definitely fits the bill!&nbsp; Access to water is one of the most important elements in a good camp, and having a pool is an added bonus for washing or staying cool in the Summer.</p>

<h3>A Mighty Feast!</h3>

<p>We rode back to camp as the sun was preparing to set, and Jeremiah cooked up a delicious meal of fried potatoes, onions and kale.&nbsp; So good!</p>
